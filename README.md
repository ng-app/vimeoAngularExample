# vimeoExample

A simple interaction with vimeo API using angularjs. [View the demo](http://seripap.github.io/vimeoAngularExample/).

If dependencies are needed, run ``bower install``

Otherwise, for development just use grunt.

```
npm install
grunt appBuild
```

## What's in it?

Pulling video data from the vimeo API, the app will render a vimeo player using a directive based on the current video selected from the collection. You can debug the app further by just running grunt and including the script files individually.
